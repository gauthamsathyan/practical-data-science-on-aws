-1,This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!,Blouses
-1,This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don't waste your time on this shirt. such a shame  it could have been very cute.,Blouses
-1,I don't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine. i also ordered the xs even though i'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked. already returned it. on the plus side  it's gorgeous.,Blouses
-1,This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well  but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16  this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time  unfortunately  neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders,Blouses
-1,I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy.,Blouses
-1,I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors  really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t,Blouses
-1,"This top did nothing for me. it billowed in the front and was not flattering. for reference  i am 5""4  115 pounds  and small chested. i ordered the smallest size the top came in (cannot recall if it was an xs or 0). i promptly returned it.",Blouses
-1,After reading the other reviewers i decided to try this out. unfortunately  the material does not fall nicely on me and the belt hits in an unflattering spot. i like the idea but it's just not a flattering cut or material. going back!,Blouses
-1,After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it  i loved the fabric and color  however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!,Blouses
0,This top is beautiful! but the fabric is really stiff and itchy. in addition  it's rather cropped or short. the real disaster and heart break for me was when i washed it. the tag recommends dry cleaning  but allows for hand washing. i should have dry cleaned - it shrunk even more when i washed it on delicate setting in cold. too bad  because this looks so cute the first time you wear it. if you're up for a dry cleaning bill and don't mind a little stiff scratchy material  you'll be fine buying t,Blouses
0,I bought this thinking it would be a great summer tunic  but it was really huge on me. i normally wear a medium but ordered down a size and it was still quite large. it was very long as well and i am 6' tall. i am normally a size 8  to give you an idea. i would recommend it  but it is going back for me.,Blouses
0,I wanted to love this top but couldn't. i am curvy (36/27/39; 32dd) and this accentuated my hips (which is not needed) and made my chest/whole shape seem boxy. i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build- the bottom would help give some shape; pleating on front would help chest seem larger. i did love the color and construction  lace details  3/4 sleeves.,Blouses
0,A pretty blouse but the polyester fabric makes it incredibly warm and uncomfortable on after a while. had to return it.,Blouses
0,Love this blouse  however upon every time i wear it  a new button pops off. i have had to replace every button!,Blouses
0,I really loved the pattern on this shirt and the colors were nice too. something a little different than a plain white shirt. however  it was a little boxy on me and the material was kind of stiff (i am realizing that i am a sucker for soft material?). if this goes on sale  i may purchase it again  but i did end up returning the shirt.,Blouses
0,"Adorable top  but i have to agree with what two other reviewers said... that is is boxy and unflattering. i have a similar patterned top  also by maeve  but the sizing on that runs small  medium  large. the s petite that i have doesn't fit quite the same as the 4 petite in this blouse. this is definitely more ""square"" in the torso  and the ruffles do stick out more - very flouncy. it just made me look frumpy instead of the sexy date night look i was going for. i am 5' and 120 lbs. also  i didn't",Blouses
0,This top is not for a curvy figure. the embroidered part is gorgeous  very stunning  but the loose bottom part is awful. i am curvy and usually wear l or xl. this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom  made me feel like i had a big tummy  and was a tad short. i am sending this back. this would look better on a more slender frame.,Blouses
0,Stylist in store warned be about issues with buttons falling of easily. loved the look  so bought it anyway. lost 2 buttons on the first wear. it did not feel snug on me  but i guess i could try a size up and see if the buttons hold a bit better. either way i will return or exchange.,Blouses
1,This is a comfortable and easy shirt that is meant to be slightly looser. i wear a size small in all cloth and stone and found this shirt to be true to size. the extra small was too tight in the shoulders and didn't have the right look to it.    same fabric as my other cloth and stone items  however  i had to steam the cuffed sleeves and back pleating after washing and drying to make it look nice and crisp. also  the cuffed sleeves are sewn that way  which i like.,Blouses
1,I love this top! i typically wear a size small and this is very true to size. it's loose fitting but does not make you look large. the pattern on the material is also fun without being too busy. perfect for fall!,Blouses
1,Cute top & well constructed. was surprised at the various gatherings i hadn't noticed before ordering  really like the billowy aspect on the bottom. received lots of compliments.,Blouses
1,This is such a cute top. i like it both off and on the shoulder. easily tucked or left out depending how you want to style it.,Blouses
1,I feel like i have a lot of blouses like this so it really needed to wow me to keep it. and while it is lovely  well made and very pretty and delicate...i just didn't feel like it was anything special. if you don't have a blouse like this  then it is a great find. but it is nothing super out of the ordinary... fit i feel is tts...i am in between a m and l...i ordered the l. lots of room in the body although i didn't like where the arms hit on me. they aren't wrist length but they aren't mid-fore,Blouses
1,Beautiful crepey fabric  lovely color. i was surprised to see gold threading in the peach option; i'm not a big gold thread fan  but it's do-able. the ruching across the back makes the fit very loose and blousy. this is not a figure-defining piece. but it's comfortable (will probably be more so after a wash to get that stiffy factory fabric finish feeling out)  and versatile.,Blouses
1,I was drawn to this blouse because it was silk and looked so well made. the color palette is an added bonus. i knew for my height to size up because it looked short. i tried on the 12 & felt it was still to short. i would have to wear a 14 or 16 to get the length i would like. i think overall this would be a great buy for a person with a smaller bust or shorter. i am 5'8 1/2 & a 36d.,Blouses
1,I saw this in the store on a beautiful autumn saturday afternoon and was inspired for what i wanted to add to my wardrobe for the season. this blouse is just fun without being loud or overpowering. the coloration works beautifully with my wardrobe and i can wear this dressed up or dressed down; with skirts  leggings  trousers  jeans...with a vest  jacket  or sweater or on its own. it is substantial enough not to wrinkle and look sloppy  it is easy to launder and will travel well with my capsule,Blouses
1,"For sizing  i normally wear either xs or s in tops (i'm 5'7""  130lbs  34a). i tried on both  and both fit  but the arm holes were a little too tight on the xs. i ended up picking the s because it felt most comfortable. when i tried on the ivory color  i could see my blue bra underneath  and it would require a cami. the black didn't. i love the embroidered design and ruffled neck. i agree the buttons on the back of the neck are a tad difficult to button  but it's not a deterrent.",Blouses
-1,I wanted to love this dress so much so that i ignored earlier reviews and purchased it in two sizes to see if i could make it work. the fabric is gorgeous  but the fit was very unflattering. it's too large on top and hangs awkwardly in both sizes. i considered tailoring to make it work but with this pattern i felt like that would be a compromise. in the end i returned both sizes ast the fabric couldn't compensate for the very unflattering fit.,Dresses
-1,"The lace and fit were good. but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowy-ish the dress is. it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something. and i hated the ""outside"" middle material  hated it. it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace. maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece.",Dresses
-1,"This dress has a beautiful fabric  i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering  absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p  i'm 5'5"" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me.",Dresses
-1,The design is very flattering and holiday appropriate. but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used. although figure flattering  the zipper is so cheap that --it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress. and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they're asking for it. maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail,Dresses
-1,In a sea of dresses  this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store. i am a pear shape  and ended up trying both the medium and the large  taking the medium home. it was super flattering on  and was an appropriate length to pair with tights.  here's where the problem happened. i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving  i put it on  and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband. so disappointed.,Dresses
-1,This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however  the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering.,Dresses
-1,I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail  i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online  the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat  i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!,Dresses
-1,The length of this dress is bizarre.  i can't decide if it's supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all - i'm not sure if i like it either way.  also- at this price point  i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent.  if you buy this dress  be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people cannot see your underwear.  the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate- the one i pur,Dresses
-1,The cut of the bodice is very strange and unflattering. it is great quality  but designed poorly. returned it.,Dresses
0,This dress arrived with a black rope belt and belt loops. i did not see this in the photo. i thought it was a throw-on-and-go dress  not a belted dress. this  in addition to the weird sizing  caused me to return it. i am a size 4-6 in dresses and the size small i ordered was skin tight and bunched at the hips.,Dresses
0,I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. i am anywhere from a size 6-8. 5'9  155lbs.  sadly  i am returning this dress because the horizontal stripes make my hips look huge.,Dresses
0,The sleeves are a bit too voluminous and the solid color collar stands out a bit too much.  but it's a cute pattern and style.  very comfortable.,Dresses
0,I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite  i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty.,Dresses
0,This is one of the best potential dresses i've seen from retailer  but it needs a do-over. i'm usually a 12 in this style of dress  but i sized up to a 16 (the largest size) and couldn't even button the top. even if i had been able to do so  i would have worn it as a tunic. i am 5'5'' and the largest size would have been a racy mini skirt at best on me if worn as a dress. this dress is fit for only the tiniest and most small-breasted of people. that said  if the company were to try again ne,Dresses
0,I wanted to love this dress so badly. it came and the material is beautiful  but when i put it on it fit so awkwardly. there was just no way to make it look good. maybe i needed a smaller size  but oh well.,Dresses
0,I ordered the stress in an xl. i usually wear a size 12 in most retailer clothes. the pattern and the flow of the dress is very beautiful but it runs extremely small. also  i felt that i was choking. it is better suited for thin women.,Dresses
0,This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip,Dresses
0,I bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal  but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack. the pattern didn't help anything  looking totally faded and washed out...the fabric and overall quality is nice  but the fit and pattern are just so..ugly  unfortunately. had to return it.,Dresses
1,This dress is effortlessly chic. i wore it with black tights and booties and it was perfection. will definitely be a casual staple year around.,Dresses
1,I bought this dress for work and post work happy hours. love it! it's material is high quality and is flattering since it falls nicely on my postpartum figure. it's a little shorter than i thought but still appropriate for work.,Dresses
1,This dress is beautiful - the pictures do not do it justice. i love the fabric and overall feel of the dress - light and airy. i have very broad shoulders and i did not feel like it look good on me so i am sending it back. too bad for me! i think the dress is perfect for weddings  parties and even everyday wear.,Dresses
1,Just got this dress in the orange print and i can't begin to say how much i love it!! looks even better in person than online and it's super flattering. love the neckline  armholes are perfect and show off toned arms and shoulders ( this is the kind of dress that makes time spent at the gym worthwhile!). the fabric is light and stretchy and the pockets are an extra bonus.  i would say fit is tts but keep in mind that it's very loose at the bottom so i would go down in size if you want a less loo,Dresses
1,Love this dress - haven't worn it yet but wow the design / artwork of the fabric is beautiful !! waiting for weather to cool off a bit so can wear with my off white suede gogo boots ....,Dresses
1,This dress was hard for me to get on but once i did...my oh my.  i am quite top heavy including my upper arms and back  so forcing the waistband over my shoulders made me panic a bit.  after the struggle  it fits like a glove and skims over all my yucky parts!  can't stop caressing the fabric and i hope my date (aka the hubs) feels the same.  dress is not lined.  i would've liked a soft mesh type lining similar to what plenty uses.  petite was sold out so i bought medium regular and it skims the,Dresses
1,"Beautiful  washes well in a garment bag on delicate. has little clips in the shoulders to hold bra straps which is crucial with the scoop back if you have sloped shoulders like mine. i normally go for a large  but was definitely a medium in this dress. 32"" waist  32f bra    only minor complaint is that the pattern (at least on the red  though probably also on the others) is just printed on the outside and the inside is faded almost white  so since the sides of the dress are slightly longer than",Dresses
1,This dress is gorgeous- it's one of those retailer dresses that i find worth the price because of how unique and beautiful it is! i found it to fit tts. although the zipper does take a good tug to get over the fabric seam  it fits perfectly. if you have a bigger chest (d+)  i would foresee this dress being too snug. however  i am a c and it fits just right! i wore it to a backyard wedding with flat sandals and simple gold hoops  but i love the idea of styling it with a jacket and some wedges or bo,Dresses
1,Sticker price was a shock but it is so worth it. it is the best little black dress i have ever owned. the lace is so soft and the dress is flattering. it is fun and flirty. this is a closet staple piece for sure!!! love this dress so much!,Dresses
-1,I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.,Fine gauge
-1,This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging  but turned out to be a disappointment. it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips. and the plum color was much darker than i expected  more of a dull brownish-burgundy.,Fine gauge
-1,This hoodie was too thin. you can see right through it. i returned it.,Fine gauge
-1,I was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted  they were short. very weird look for a wrap. returned.,Fine gauge
-1,Based on the strength of the other reviews  i thought this sweater would be amazing  but i was disappointed. the knit is very thin  cheap looking and weak that it won't last a season undamaged. it reminds me of a duster i bought 15 years ago at a discount fast-fashion retailer when i was a student. sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package. collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare. the drape is not structured enough--everything about this screams over priced bath,Fine gauge
-1,After washing this top pilled terribly. it is beautiful  but only for one use.,Fine gauge
-1,And not in a good way. everywhere i went  i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on  i was picking balls of fabric off the couch  bed  and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style  fabric and fit (although a little on the long side ) but there's no way i can keep it.,Fine gauge
-1,This sweater is very long  could be worn as a dress at 5'3 !,Fine gauge
-1,The pattern and fabric are lovely  but the sleeves are short (unlike the photo) so it drapes very strangely. i personally could not figure out how to wear it so that it looked anything remotely like the photo. had to return this one.,Fine gauge
0,The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest  it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model  so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!,Fine gauge
0,This a heavy cotton which is great for fall. design is cute and pockets are interesting. the fit is boxy and can look bulky. i only recommend if it's on sale.,Fine gauge
0,On the picture shows the belt.doesn't come with the belt.,Fine gauge
0,I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried  i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy,Fine gauge
0,This sweater is great i bought the black version on sale. my complaint is the pulling factor though. you don't expect retailer sweaters to pill after a couple wears. overall i love the fit and look though so i continue to overlook it and use my sweater comb as needed!,Fine gauge
0,I love this piece because of its flattering stripes.i am 5' 9''  150 lbs and ordered a medium. the large was just too big  the small too short and tight  but the medium fit well. however  the sleeves are a little large which was a disappointment  and because of this there's an awkward excess of fabric on the front next to the armpits. i also experienced that the shirt is not long enough to tuck in  how the model has done.,Fine gauge
0,This is a thick sweater. it is pretty  but has a short length.,Fine gauge
0,I'm not much for ponchos  but this one looked unique. it is thin  kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online   and it was wide horizontally. the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic. the turtleneck was thick and itchy. it was a return.,Fine gauge
0,This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad  but unexpected. i am very short -waisted  and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished  and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.,Fine gauge
1,I read the reviews before i bought this sweater online. one person did mention that the side slits were cut very high  but i had no idea! when i tried the xs on at home i was quite surprised by just how high up those side slits were. with just a pair of jeans  you could see flesh! at first i thought it maybe wouldn't work  but i decided to keep it because everything else about the sweater is lovely. i'll be layering this with a tank underneath. it's a bit quirky and funky and that appeals to me!,Fine gauge
1,Better than a regular boring cardigan. goes with short sleeves and dresses!!,Fine gauge
1,This is such a great top - it can be easily dressed up or down. i love my tops flowy  and this is just that! i have a larger chest (34d) and the flowy nature of it keeps it from being too short up front. even though it has eyelits in it  it can be worn without a cami underneath as long as you wear a good nude bra. it'll be a great sweater for all seasons. i'm even able to wear it to work. highly highly recommend.,Fine gauge
1,I am usually a medium/large and was pleased to fit in the small/medium that i ordered after reading some of the reviews. lovely piece  great to wear over a short sleeve t-shirt  3/4 of a sleeve shirt or even a long sleeve shirt when weather permits here in florida. very happy i ordered this!!,Fine gauge
1,So simple to throw on with jeans  or you could dress it up. the ruffles give it a little extra flair. nice and soft  really comfy. i haven't decided which size i am going to hold onto. i ordered in a small and a medium. small fits me great  and i am usually a pretty standard medium. i think it just depends on what look you are going for.  wish they had it in a lighter color  like an ivory or pink.  i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade.,Fine gauge
1,I am so happy with this! i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving it as i expected it to be of lesser quality than what i found it to be. it is a medium weight weave  grey sweater with a beautiful design and texture; one of those pieces that you will tire of long before it wears out! it is a great layering piece but not over bulky or structured tops as it is very smooth fitting without a whole lot of give. that is to say it is not loosely woven so it is better over a snug fitting item. the colo,Fine gauge
1,"When i first received this sweater  i was a little worried about the bulk  especially the thick cables and popcorn stitches. after i got it on and adjusted it to all the right places  i would say it looks similar to the model in the photo. i did not find it itchy. the yarn is soft and airy but i guess it depends on how sensitive your skin is. the length was low hip on me and i'm 5'9"" tall. overall  i'm very pleased and looking forward to wearing it. can't speak to the quality of the garment beca",Fine gauge
1,This sweater is way cuter in person. the picture online does not really show the adorable contrast of the snails to the rest of the sweater. also  it looks like they photoshopped out the fact that the buttons run the whole length of the front. really cute and soft (not itchy). highly recommend,Fine gauge
1,I recently purchased this cardigan and got so many compliments the first day i wore it.  the detail is so exquisite  it will be worth every penny.,Fine gauge
-1,It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however  i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.,Intimates
-1,"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2""  114#  34b",Intimates
-1,The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however  the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :(,Intimates
-1,You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?,Intimates
-1,"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer  please get the fit right!!",Intimates
-1,I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!,Intimates
-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,Intimates
-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,Intimates
-1,"This nightgown looked so comfy and cute! i ordered a large and it was so uncomfortably tight.i'm 5'3"" and 150lbs. it was such a shame. size large should not just be really a medium!",Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however  i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight  perhaps that might help with the fit?,Intimates
0,I love and live in these but the recent scoop tanks i purchased were thin  not as great. so i want to recommend them because they are really versatile but the quality has deminished.,Intimates
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates
0,Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute  it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.,Intimates
0,I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,Intimates
0,As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.,Intimates
0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",Intimates
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates
1,"I purchased this in the black and received it today.  it is silky feeling and is a quality camisole.  the color is a muted black  not all shiny as some silks are (and they often look cheap) but this looks great and could be worn alone  under leather  or with a sweater/kimono.  i usually wear a medium in tops  and this fit true to size.  i am 5'2"" and it doesn't look too long  but i do wish it came in a petite.  still keeping it!",Intimates
1,Just received the bra and matching panty in the mail and loved it. the true color is a little darker  i would call it a taupe. the fabric is really nice. i am a 34 c and ordered a medium just from my freepeople bra experiences  and they run small. the medium is perfect for my size. i usually order a small panty  and this one fits  it looks smaller than pictured on the model. this set is one of a kind  the pattern on fabric is really beautiful. i think it is worth the price. if you like lingerie ,Intimates

-1,I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts  length is fine...the inside is some  but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.,Jackets
-1,I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it's going back. because the fabric is coated  it does not drape or hang nicely at all. i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible. i'm usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me.,Jackets

-1,Even at a very deep discount  this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it  but as i discovered when it arrived  that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for,Jackets
-1,I generally don't write bad reviews  but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great  but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin  so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time  and this is not a $98 item of clothing.,Jackets
-1,This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews  but it was way too big. sadly  i had to return it.,Jackets
0,First  the good: i like the basic shape of the jacket  with its crisply cut lapels  and rounded corners at the bottom...the functional pockets (including the  cool watch pocket)  the size of the buttons  the color. i got the honey   and it was lovely and intense . now  the bad:  i got the regular 8. the jacket is at least an inch too short. although it's  a small  tight 8  the sleeves are strikingly too long. they would have to  be folded  and the lining which would show is not that attractive.,Jackets
0,The fabric is beautiful  even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large  as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure  even though it's a lapel  and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs  and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad  as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.,Jackets

0,It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however  i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however  i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.,Jackets
0,I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also  it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal,Jackets
0,"The kimono is as pictured. the colors are true to what is shown on line  though the description indicates ""green multi""--it is not green. i returned the item  however. the quality is fine  but it seemed extremely over-priced to me. it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality.",Jackets
0,Ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs. i liked the length and overall fit of the xs  however  i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped. the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked. overall  it?s not a terrible vest but just not for me.,Jackets
0,Gorgeous  but the trim detail on both in-store coats was already trashed and falling apart. for $218 and it can't even make it out of the store intact? i love the look but didn't want it to fall apart. they should've done an extra reinforcing stitch on the trim. such a shame!!,Jackets
0,The colors on this jacket are a murky blue with a pale mauve tone for the lighter color. size is a bit on the large size. i did not feel that the jacket was that well-made and would hold up to much wear. i was looking for a jacket to dress up jeans  black pants etc and this did not fit that need. it would be a warm jacket if that is a need.,Jackets

-1,I've never had a problem with pilcro jeans. i own several pairs. however  i ordered my regular size 28 (i'm 5'3  120 pounds) and not only were these jeans thin  they had zero stretch and after 1 hour of wear stretched out horribly. they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean.,Jeans
-1,I was extremely excited to receive these pants  given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what  but be cautious ordering these pants.,Jeans
-1,Where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go??? these are a cheap impersonator. the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half. the last 3 pairs of pilcro stets i've ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally. the pockets on these jeans sit so so low- completely unflattering. the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially. the old stet ankle jeans ha,Jeans

1,The fabric of these pants isn't like regular denim  rather it's soft and velvety in texture more like a chino. i love the dark saturated olive green. the pocket placement is very flattering on the rear. normally i wear a size 31 in premium denim and size 30 in paige jimmy jimmy jeans  however in this particular pair i needed a size 29. i definitely recommend sizing down!,Jeans
1,Lots of stretch in fabric so pants fit well. length is perfect for me. i'm almost 5ft 6 in and they hit at bottom of ankles with slightly extra fabric so flats  heels  or boots work great with these pants. i bought size 29 and i'm 135 lbs. colors in pants are beautiful. many different colored tops go well with them,Jeans
1,I love these jeans. they're incredibly soft  super comfortable and hold their shape. i can wear them for hours on end and i don't get that droopy  snagging look jeans can get when they stretch out.        fit: i am normally a 29/30 depending on the jean. i took these in the 30 - i usually have a difficult time finding skinny jeans that fit my legs and don't fall off my waist. these have enough give to accommodate my larger legs  but the material holds well  so i don't need a belt to keep them up,Jeans
1,First of all  this jean fits really well  but i usually wear a 31 in mother jeans and i had to go up to a 32 in these (ugh!) because they just ran smaller or whatever. i am curvy on the bottom but the 31's just felt too tight and pulled everywhere.  second  the color is not quite right in this picture; it looks more military green. it is not - it is a much brighter military green vs a moss green. that is throwing me a bit. not quite as versatile or neutral to me.  meanwhile  the styling with the,Jeans

1,I'm giving these leggings 5 stars although i did return them. first off i do love pilcro jeans and leggings. beware these are not jeans at all. the tag says serif legging. these are excellent leggings if that's what you're looking for. i thought they were jeans and was willing to spend the money on them  but not for leggings. i'll consider buying if they go on sale.,Jeans
1,I ordered these in the blue size 28p. i am 5' 120 lbs. a size 6p and curvy. the jeans fit very nicely in thigh and hip area (and i don't have skinny thighs). the jean is not a low rise which is what i was looking for. i was looking for a jean that was a little dressier yo wear out to grab a drink or catch a movie. these jeans fit the bill because they give off a polished vibe  especially when paired with a dressier top  blazer  skinny belt and heels. also  i like that the jeans don't have the to,Jeans

1,This is such a pretty top. i do not feel it runs big  as another review mentioned. to fit the sleeves comfortably (i do not have large arms at all) i did choose to take a small over my usual xs so the body is a bit llonger than shown on the model (a bit more of a tunic fit on me). it is really a pretty top either way  the xs fitting like it does in the picture on the model and the s fitting a bit longer. worried just a bit that it might develop holes as some tissue tees do.,Knits

(the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest  and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl  and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun,Knits

0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering

1,This dress is beautiful and unusual. i think the colors shown in the picture are a little brighter than the dress i bought...the turquoise and gold seem slightly more muted in person  which isn't necessarily a bad thing. there are sequins along the shoulders of the dress that you also can't see in the picture  but they aren't gaudy or too stevie nicks-bohemian. i didn't find the bodice of the size m too tight as another reviewer noted...it's' my normal size  and though i'm a little chesty (32-34,Trend
1,I love these jeans. i am usually a size 27 or 28 in boyfriend jeans and i kept the size 28. i chose the baggier fit. the size 27 did fit  but it was a more fitted look. so i guess i would say you could definitely go with your regular boyfriend size and pick the fit that you prefer. i really feel like this is a jean that you should try on before purchasing  but the availability of these makes it almost impossible. i literally stalked the site so i could purchase both sizes and choose the ones tha,Trend
1,"Gorgeous flowy dress that's great for three seasons. thank you to the previous reviewers for the fit advice. size small was only available and it fits perfectly on me (i'm an m/l on top). i'm short and will have to hem because even with 3"" heels i kept stepping on the back skirt. bodice opening is wide and gapes too much so i will wear a cami bra or fashion tape or have an additional fastener sewn in. there are bright little balls of red trim and unexpected pops of violet embroidery  adding to t",Trend
1,"This dress is so light and twirly and the fabric is as airy as it is pretty. sadly the fit was a bit off. i am 5'7""  128. i tried on my usual sz 2 and found the top to be saggy at the armpits but too tight at the waist seam; going up to a 4 only made for a saggier top. most likely a great dress for lean or long-torsoed ladies  which sadly i'm not!",Trend
